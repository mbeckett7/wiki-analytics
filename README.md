Jython code for use in OpenRefine was generated by providing a generative AI model (Open AI GPT4o) with Python code examples from Confluence Cloud REST API documentation (https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/intro/#about), then asking the AI to customize for Jython. Code was tested and refined by human interacting with AI model.
